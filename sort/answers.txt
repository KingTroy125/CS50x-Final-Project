sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: Bubble sort shows distinct performance characteristics with different input orders. When I ran the program on:

random10000.txt: Moderate performance
reversed10000.txt: Very slow execution time
sorted10000.txt: Fastest execution time

sort2 uses: Merge Sort


How do you know?: Merge sort demonstrates consistent performance across different input types:

random10000.txt: Consistently fast
reversed10000.txt: Same fast performance
sorted10000.txt: Uniform execution time

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: Selection sort shows uniform time complexity across all input types:

random10000.txt: Consistent time
reversed10000.txt: Same execution time
sorted10000.txt: Nearly identical performance
